## License

See the files LICENSE and COPYING for license terms.

## Running the server

This requires a version of node which supports ES 2015.  I'm testing with node 7.2.0.  If you have nvm installed, you can update node by typing "nvm install node".

Clone the repository, and install npm.  Then in the project root directory, run:

npm install
gulp
gulp watch

This will start a web server at localhost:3000, and open the page in your default browser.
