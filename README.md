## License

See the files LICENSE and COPYING for license terms.

## Running the server

This requires a version of node which supports ES 2015.  I'm testing with node 7.2.0.  If you have nvm installed, you can update node by typing `nvm install node`.

You will also need to have npm installed.

Clone the repository.  In the project root directory, run:

```
npm install
gulp
gulp watch
```

This will start a web server at http://localhost:3000, and open the page in your default browser.
